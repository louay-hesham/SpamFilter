Subject: Morsi, Louay Hesham Saber Mohamed - application submitted in Egypt

Good day Mohamed
 
Thank you for your emails and I am sorry that your visa has not been issued yet. As the embassy and consulates are closed Friday and Saturday, Sunday would be the next available day to process your visa application.
 
We will however contact the mission to request they issue your visa as soon as possible and I will keep you updated. If you do receive contact, please let us know right away, thank you.  
 
May I ask if you have booked a flight? If so, what are your planned dates of travel?
 
Kind regards
Brandon
